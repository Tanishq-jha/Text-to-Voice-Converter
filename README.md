# Text-to-Voice-Converter
A JavaScript-based text-to-speech converter web application that converts written text into spoken words.

The Text-to-Speech Converter project is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering users the ability to convert written text into audible speech. In the HTML structure, input fields allow users to enter the text they wish to convert, while buttons trigger the conversion process and control playback.

CSS styling enhances the visual presentation of the converter, ensuring clarity and ease of use for the user interface. JavaScript plays a central role in the functionality of the project, utilizing the Web Speech API to generate speech from the provided text input dynamically.

Through event listeners and DOM manipulation, users can interact with the converter by entering text and initiating the speech synthesis process with the click of a button. JavaScript functions handle the text-to-speech conversion, controlling aspects such as voice selection, speech rate, and playback.

This project provides an educational experience in JavaScript programming and showcases the capabilities of modern web technologies in creating accessible and interactive applications. Additionally, it demonstrates the practical application of text-to-speech technology, offering users a convenient tool for tasks such as reading text-based content aloud or assisting individuals with visual impairments.
